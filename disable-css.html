      <h2>Defend and Preserve Earth's Creative Potential</h2>
      <p>The originating powers of the Ecosphere are expressed through its resilient geographic ecosystems. Therefore, as first priority, the ecocentric philosophy urges preservation and restoration of natural ecosystems and their component species. Barring planet-destroying collisions with comets and asteroids, Earth's evolving inventiveness will continue for millions of years, hampered only where humans have destroyed whole ecosystems by exterminating species or by toxifying sediments, water and air. The permanent darkness of extinction removes strands in the organic web, reducing the beauty of the Earth and the potential for the future emergence of unique ecosystems with companion organisms, some possibly of greater-than-human sensitivity and intelligence.</p>
